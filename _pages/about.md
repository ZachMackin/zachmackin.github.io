Hello, I am Zach Mackin!

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Statistics at [Texas A&M University](https://artsci.tamu.edu/statistics/index.html), where I am advised by [Raymond Wong](https://raymondkww.github.io/) and co-advised by [Bani Mallick](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/bani-k-mallick).  I am also an NSF NRT-AI fellow. Previously, I graduated with a degree in Statistics and Computer Science at the [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My technical research broadly includes Functional Data Analysis, uncertainty quantification in deep learning models, and forecasting. In addition to this, I research factors that pose societal risks, including AI Alignment, Nuclear Warfare, and Authoritarianism.

My research experience has been in a variety of domains from identifying illegal sand mines with the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/), reducing risk of wildfires as a member of the Public Safety Power Shutoff team at [PG&E](https://www.pge.com/), forecasting human sleep data with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/), exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive teaching experience in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science. 

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, golf, disc golf (I am a member of the TAMU Disc Golf Team), traveling, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152234697-zach-mackin), and [writing](https://zachmackin.substack.com/).
