Hello, I am Zach Mackin!

I am currently a PhD Candidate in Statistics at [Texas A&M University](https://artsci.tamu.edu/statistics/index.html). Before that, I graduated with a degree in Statistics and Computer Science at [University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). My technical research includes Deep Learning, Bayesian Causal Inference, and Extreme Value Theory/Risk Analysis. Outside of this, I research factors that cause societal risk, such as AI Alignment, Nuclear Warfare, and Authortarianism. 


My research experience has been in a variety of domains from identifying illegal sand minds with the [UC Berkeley School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/), reducing risk of wildfires as a member of the Public Safety Power Shutoff team at [PG&E](https://www.pge.com/), forecasting human sleep data with the [Center for Human Sleep Science](https://www.humansleepscience.com/), exploring a country's risk of defaulting with the [Economist Intelligence Unit](https://eiu.com),  accounting for growth in pollution within the Chesapeake Bay with the [Chesapeake Legal Alliance](https://chesapeakelegal.org), and effectively developing UAVs with [Berkeley EECS](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/).

Additionally, I have extensive [teaching experiences]() within Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Data Science courses.

In my free time I enjoy hiking, golf, disc golf (I am a member of the TAMU Disc Golf Team), traveling, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152234697-zach-mackin), [writing](https://medium.com/@zmackin307), and developing forecasts for sports, geopolitics, and existential risk. 

Thank you for visiting my page! To reach out you can send an email to zmackin307 (at) gmail (dot) com or connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-mackin-408ba51bb/).
